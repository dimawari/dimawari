## About Me

Currently taking up a **BS in Information Systems**, and learning how systems are built — and how to break them (strategically).

- QA aspirant who enjoys finding issues before users do  
- Focused on **black box testing** and hands-on manual QA work  
- Curious, detail-driven, and always looking for ways to improve processes  
- Learning both the technical and human side of quality assurance

## Things About Me (・∀・)

- I don’t write bugs (yet), but I find them well  
- Caffeine occasionally helps me debug life choices  
- I treat errors as plot twists, not failures  
- I don’t trust a feature until I’ve poked at it at least 10 different ways  
- Outside of testing, I like music, cooking, and systems that don’t crash

---

## Looking Ahead

- Planning to pursue QA certifications (ISTQB Foundation Level)  
- Open to internship or entry-level QA opportunities  
- Long-term goal: become a QA Engineer focused on usability and user experience
