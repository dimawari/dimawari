## 🤓 Who Am I?

🎓 A curious student of **BS Information Systems**, trying to figure out if semicolons or tabs cause more chaos.  
🧪 Future **QA Engineer** (aka the person who *breaks* your app before the users do).  
🕵️‍♀️ Specializing in **black box testing**—because it’s more fun when you don’t know what’s inside, right?
