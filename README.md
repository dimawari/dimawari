## 🤓 Who Am I?

🎓 A curious student of **BS Information Systems**, trying to figure out if semicolons or tabs cause more chaos.  
🧪 **QA Engineer** aspirant (aka the person who *breaks* your app before the users do).  
🕵️‍♀️ Specializing in **black box testing**—because it’s more fun when you don’t know what’s inside, right?

---

## 🧰 Toolbox (a.k.a My Survival Kit)

- Languages: `HTML` | `CSS` | `JavaScript`  
- Tools: `GitHub` | `VS Code`   
- Testing Brainpower: `Black Box Testing` | `Manual Testing` | `Bug Reporting`
- I’m currently learning: `Postman` | `JIRA`

## 🛠️ Currently Working On

- Breaking things (intentionally) to make them better 💥  
- Learning the art of writing **clear, polite bug reports**  
- Exploring open-source testing playgrounds 🧩

## 📚 Fun Facts

- 🐛 I don’t write bugs (yet), but I find them very well.
- ☕ I measure productivity in cups of coffee.
- 🧠 I treat errors as plot twists in my coding story.
- 🧷 I trust nothing unless I’ve poked it 10 different ways.
