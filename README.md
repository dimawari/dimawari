## Things About Me

- I don’t write bugs (yet), but I find them well  
- Caffeine occasionally helps me debug life choices  
- I treat errors as plot twists, not failures  
- I don’t trust a feature until I’ve poked at it at least 10 different ways  
- Outside of testing, I like music, cooking, and systems that don’t crash

---

## Looking Ahead

- Open to internship or entry-level QA opportunities  
- Long-term goal: become a QA Engineer focused on usability and user experience
