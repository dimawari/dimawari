## 🤓 Who Am I?

- A curious student of **BS Information Systems**, trying to figure out if semicolons or tabs cause more chaos. 🎓
- **QA Engineer** aspirant (aka the person who *breaks* your app before the users do). 🧪
- Specializing in **black box testing**—because it’s more fun when you don’t know what’s inside, right? 🕵️‍♀️

---

## 🧰 Toolbox (a.k.a My Survival Kit)

- Languages: `HTML` | `CSS` | `JavaScript`  
- Tools: `GitHub` | `VS Code`   
- Testing Brainpower: `Black Box Testing` | `Manual Testing` | `Bug Reporting`
- I’m currently learning: `Postman` | `JIRA`

## 🛠️ Currently Working On

- Breaking things (intentionally) to make them better 💥  
- Learning the art of writing **clear, polite bug reports**  
- Exploring open-source testing playgrounds 🧩

## 📚 Fun Facts

- 🐛 I don’t write bugs (yet), but I find them very well.  
- ☕ I measure productivity in cups of coffee.  
- 🧠 I treat errors as plot twists in my coding story.  
- 🧷 I trust nothing unless I’ve poked it 10 different ways.  
- 🎧 I’m a Swiftie and my favorite album is *reputation* (dark, glitchy, iconic — just like good bug hunts).  
- 🍳 I enjoy cooking — just like how life cooks (and roasts) me.

## 📂 QA Input Sample

I once did QA for a classmate’s project — tested features, poked at bugs, and left behind some constructive chaos. 🐞
